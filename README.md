# Not real viruses!!!
## These are fake viruses like spam-opening command promt or doubling a info window instead closing it.
### You can troll your friends with these, not use them as real ransom- or malware

# Tutorial
- cmdspam.bat: loop-open command promt until crash, hard reset needed after execution
- duplicatingwindow.vbs: duplicates window when OK button pressed or tried to close, escapable using taskmanager
- OPCrasher.vbs: spam-opens Warning field and spam-executes cmdspam.bat, cmdspam.bat needs to be in same directory and not renamed, __WILL CRASH YOUR PC AND MAYBE CORRUPT SOMETHING__
- OPCrasher.exe: OPCrasher.vbs and cmdspam.bat bundeled in exe, __WILL CRASH YOUR PC PARTS AND MAYBE CORRUPT SOMETHING__

### Every file(__!!except for cmdspam.bat when used for OPCrasher.vbs!!__) can be renamed and all Icons can be changed without something breaking.
### You can escape every fake Virus(except for cmdspam.bat), but only if the crashing part didn't start!
